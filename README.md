Federal Contracting System
==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, skeleton application using the ZF2 MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with ZF2.

Installation
------------
Alternately, clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped
`composer.phar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    git clone git@github.com:f-technology/fcs.git
    cd fcs
    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

Virtual Host
------------
Afterwards, set up a virtual host to point to the public_html/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go!
